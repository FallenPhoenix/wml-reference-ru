== the toplevel [binary_path] tag ==

This tag is used to recognize more than one directory as containing images, music, and sound. It only has one key:
* '''path''': a directory. When an image is not found it the normal ''images'' directory, it will be looked for in '''''path'''/images''. Similarly, music will be looked for in '''''path'''/music'', and sound in '''''path'''/sound''.
Notice that '''''path''''' is still relative to the main Wesnoth directory.

[binary_path] should only be used where necessary. For example a multiplayer era should have its [binary_path] inside an #ifdef MULTIPLAYER instead of outside it in order to avoid possible clashes with single-player content.
