{{WML Tags}}

The time of day influences damage done by lawful and chaotic units; this makes timing of your attack important.
Graphically time of day is represented by a picture (landscape with sun or moon) in the status table, and by darkening the screen during night turns.

Scenario author can schedule the times of day in scenario; use the pre-defined time macros, or create new times of day.

== The [time] tag ==

The [time] tag is a subtag of the [scenario] tag. However, most scenarios do not use these directly, but usually use the ready macros '''{DAWN}, {MORNING}, {AFTERNOON}, {DUSK}, {FIRST_WATCH}, {SECOND_WATCH}''' and '''{UNDERGROUND}''' to specify the day-night cycle.
See '''data/core/macros/schedules.cfg''' for the definitions of these IDs.

The [time] tag describes a single turn of a day/night sequence. When a scenario is played, the first turn is described by the first [time] tag; the second described by the second, until there are no more. After all the tags have described a turn, the next turn is described by the first tag again.


The [time] tag recognizes the following keys:

* '''id''': the id by which you can reference this time, e.g. in the ''time_of_day'' tag of [[AiWML]].
* '''name''': (translatable) the name displayed when the cursor is over the day/night image.
* '''image''': the image displayed at the top of the Status Table during turns of this type.
* '''mask''': the image displayed over all hexes during turns of this type.
* '''lawful_bonus''': units with '''alignment=lawful''' do +''lawful_bonus'' % damage during turns of this type. Units with '''alignment=chaotic''' do -''lawful_bonus'' % damage. Units with '''alignment=neutral''' are unaffected by this key. Units with '''alignment=liminal''' do -(abs(''lawful_bonus'')) % damage. ''lawful_bonus'' can be a negative number. This is useful if you want to give Chaotic units an advantage instead of Lawful ones.
* '''red''', '''green''', '''blue''': describe the tint of the screen during the time period.  Appears to be an integer value from -255 to 255.  See schedules.cfg for examples.
* '''sound''': a sound to play (in sounds/) when changing into this time of day.

=== Scheduling time ===

The [scenario] tag contains a few [time] tags (or macros).
These time tags are used in a loop, that is: first time tag is used during the first turn, then second one,... and when all time tags passed then again the first one, second one, etc.

The typical day/night cycle looks like this:

 {DAWN}
 {MORNING}
 {AFTERNOON}
 {DUSK}
 {FIRST_WATCH}
 {SECOND_WATCH}

To avoid day/night cycle, use a neutral time of day, for example:

 {DAWN}

In underground, use a special time of day.
It works like night; that is it gives advantage to chaotic units and disadvantage to lawful units.

 {UNDERGROUND}
