{{WML Tags}}
== the toplevel [fonts] tag  ==


The '''[fonts]''' tag describes fonts which are distributed with the game. Each font must be declared here to be used by the game.

The '''[fonts]''' tag has an element, '''order''', and a possible child tag, '''[font]'''

* '''order''': describes the order in which fonts are to be tried until the program finds one which contains the character to be displayed. ''order'' should be marked as translatable.
* '''[font]''': the [font] tag describes one installed font. It contains the following elements:
** '''name''': the filename of the font, without fonts/ prepended
** '''codepoints''': a list of Unicode codepoints (character codes) which are present in this font. This should be a list of comma-separated ranges, "ranges" being either a number, or a dash separated range (for example: "32-126").
