{{WML Tags}}
==  Abilities and their effects ==

There are two types of abilities: ones that apply to units (called ''abilities'') and ones that only apply when using a particular attack (called ''specials'' or ''weapon specials'').  A unit may have multiple abilities and an attack can have multiple specials, but by convention only one weapon special should be assigned to any given attack.

== Тег ''[abilities]'' ==

The following tags are used to describe an ability in WML:

* '''[heals]''': modifies the hitpoints of a unit at the beginning of the healer's turn
* '''[regenerate]''': modifies the hitpoints of a unit at the beginning of the unit's turn
* '''[resistance]''': modifies the resistance of a unit to damage
* '''[leadership]''': modifies the damage of a unit
* '''[skirmisher]''': Позволяет игнорировать вражеские зоны контроля.
* '''[illuminates]''': modifies the time of day adjacent to the affected units
* '''[teleport]''': allows the unit to teleport
* '''[hides]''': Делает бойца невидимым для врагов.
Any other name is valid (for example '''[dummy]'''), but will result in an ability that does nothing but report it's there. These tags still use the same common keys and tags as every other ability. '''Note:''' a dummy ability must have an id for the name and description to display.

=== Common keys and tags for every ability ===

* '''name''': the name of the ability.
* '''name_inactive''': the name of the ability when inactive.
* '''description''': the description of the ability.
* '''description_inactive''': the description of the ability when inactive.
* '''affect_self''': if equal to 'yes', the ability will affect the unit that has it.
* '''affect_allies''': if equal to 'yes', the ability will affect allies in the specified adjacent hexes.
* '''affect_enemies''': if equal to 'yes', the ability will affect enemies in the specified adjacent hexes.
* '''cumulative''': if set to 'yes', this ability will be cumulative with the base value for this ability.
* '''id''': this ability will not be cumulative with other abilities using this id. Must be present if cumulative is anything other than 'yes'.
* '''[adjacent_description]''': contains all four of the above keys, which are used when an adjacent unit receives the ability.
* '''[filter]''': [[StandardUnitFilter]] If the unit owning the ability does not match this filter, the ability will be inactive.
* '''[affect_adjacent]''': each adjacent unit that does not match this filter will not receive its effects.
** '''adjacent''': a comma seperated list of any combination of these directions: '''n''','''ne''','''se''','''s''','''sw''','''nw'''.
** '''[filter]''': [[StandardUnitFilter]].
* '''[filter_self]''': if the owner of the ability does not match this filter, it will not receive the effects of the ability. [filter_self] takes a [[StandardUnitFilter]] as argument.
* '''[filter_base_value]''': filters on the value before any modifications; uses the keys '''equals''', '''not_equals''', etc. If several keys are used all have to match.

=== Extra keys used by the ''[heals]'' ability ===

* '''value''': the amount healed.
* '''poison''': can be one of ''slowed'',''cured''.

=== Extra keys used by the ''[regenerate]'' ability ===

* '''value''': the amount healed.
* '''poison''': can be one of ''slowed'',''cured''.

=== Extra keys and tags used by the ''[resistance]'' ability ===

* '''value''': set resistance to this value.
* '''max_value''': maximum resistance value. This value '''must''' be set in order for [resistance] to function.
* '''add''': adds to resistance.
* '''sub''': subtracts from resistance.
* '''multiply''': multiplies resistance value. 
* '''divide''': divides resistance value.
* '''apply_to''': a list of damage types; if left out, the ability applies to all types.
* '''active_on''': one of 'defense' or 'offense'; if left out, the ability is active on both.

* '''value''': the percentage bonus to damage.

=== Extra keys used by the ''[illuminates]'' ability ===

* '''value''': the percentage bonus to lawful units.
* '''max_value''': the maximum percentage bonus given.
* '''min_value''': the minimum percentage bonus given.

=== Extra keys used by the ''[hides]'' ability ===

* '''alert''': the displayed text when the unit is discovered. Default "Ambushed!".

=== Extra tags used by the ''[teleport]'' ability ===

* '''[tunnel]''' - a tunnel tag (see [[DirectActionsWML]]) (without the remove key) defining the tunneling source and target hexes, and maybe other conditions. (It automatically applies only to the unit with the ability.)  You may use $teleport_unit inside the tunnel tag for filtering purposes.
