{{WML Tags}}
== Wiki Syntax ==

==== Formatting ====

This page is an example of how these wikis should be formatted:

Description of the page

* '''[tag]''' description of [tag]
** '''key''': description of ''key''.
"'''key'''" can refer either to the key ''key'' or the value of ''key''
* '''key2''': description of ''key2''
** '''value''': what happens when the attribute '''key2=value''' is set

Example:
 [tag]
         key=0
 [/tag]
 key2=value

==== Version Control ====

This wiki describes the stable version of Wesnoth, but also has marked notes about the development version. See [[DevFeature]].

==== Categorization ====

WML reference pages should be placed into the category "WML reference."  This allows someone to easily bring up all the WML-related pages at once.

To do this, add the text <nowiki>[[Category: WML Reference]]</nowiki> at the bottom of the page under the "See Also" section.
